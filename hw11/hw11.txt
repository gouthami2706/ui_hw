1) explain about arr.forEach and arr.map . compare the differences?
2) object and object methods (.hasOwnProperty(item))
3) diff ways of creating an object
4) understand about properties in object. look into about adding property, delete a property, edit property value, check if a property exists?
5) what is prototype in object





1) explain about arr.forEach and arr.map . compare the differences?
arr.foreach(): It usally apply the function for each and every element in the array
arr.map():It does the same thing like foreach method and returns the modified elements in a array
2) object and object methods (.hasOwnProperty(item))


object:An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.
empty object {}
object will have properties 
each property has key and value
objectname.propertykey gives u the required value
object.hasOwnProperty('keyvalue') returns boolean value either true or false


3)diff ways of creating an object:
object literals
defining objects normally
objectname{ propertyname: value; }

Object property names can be any string, including the empty string. If the property name would not be a valid JavaScript identifier or number, it must be enclosed in quotes. Property names that are not valid identifiers also cannot be accessed as a dot (.) property, but can be accessed and set with the array-like notation("[]").

var unusualPropertyNames = {
  "": "An empty string",
  "!": "Bang!"
}
console.log(unusualPropertyNames."");   // SyntaxError: Unexpected string
console.log(unusualPropertyNames[""]);  // An empty string
console.log(unusualPropertyNames.!);    // SyntaxError: Unexpected token !
console.log(unusualPropertyNames["!"]); // Bang!

instead of using . for empty srting and some other special characters(!) we use '[]'

---using constructor function
u can create many objects using instance of key word new
define object using constructor func

function name(arguments)
{
	assign  arguments using this

}

using new keyword create objects

arguments can be objects

eg:
var rand = new Person("Rand McKinnon", 33, "M");
function Car(make, model, year, owner) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.owner = owner;
}
var car1 = new Car("Eagle", "Talon TSi", 1993, rand);// rand --object
we have owner function


---- using object.create
define one object
 var fish =object.create(animal);




5) what is prototype in object

it is an object which helps in adding similar property key to various objects
