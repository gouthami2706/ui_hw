call, apply bind uses

usually when u define a function in one obj
if u call obj.function it will return values in obj or local variables
otherwise if u call only function it will return global variables
so instead of getting global variables we use call before fun, so we get local variables

//functionname.call(objname)
in this case this is replaced by obj

call and apply perform as same in  func with no arguments
but with argumentsarreys has to be passed in array in apply

in apply u can assign array values arr=[]

in bind this keyword is permanently replaced by new fun
